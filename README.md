# Contacts-Page
Submission for my Resonate Technical Test Q2
------------------------------------------------------
Good Day! I used ReactJS to create a page for Contacts. Here's how to run the application:
1. Download my repository here into a ZIP file.
2. Locate the ZIP file and extract it into a folder.
3. Locate and copy the location path of the project folder.
4. Run the command prompt. Use the cd command to get into the project folder like the example below:
```
cd {location path of the project folder} (ex. cd C:/contacts-app)
```
5. To make sure that the project is fully functioning, kindly install the following packages using node package manager in the project folder:
```
npm install axios
npm install @mui/material
npm install @mui/icons-material
```
Note: Make sure you have NodeJS to execute these command lines in the command prompt, you can download it for free in https://nodejs.org/en/download \

6. Run the application in the command prompt using 
```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Thank you!
